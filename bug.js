While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the development server wouldn't start properly.  The error message was vague, simply stating 'Error: Command failed'.  The expo start command would hang indefinitely and I couldn't find any logs to help me debug. I tried restarting my computer, clearing the cache, and reinstalling Node and Expo CLI, but the problem persisted. The issue only appeared on a specific project and did not occur in other Expo projects.
