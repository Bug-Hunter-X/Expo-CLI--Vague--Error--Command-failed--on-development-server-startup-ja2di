# Expo CLI Development Server Startup Failure

This repository demonstrates a problem where the Expo CLI development server fails to start, returning only a vague 'Error: Command failed' message.  The issue only affects a specific project and standard troubleshooting steps (restarting the computer, clearing the cache, reinstalling Node and Expo CLI) did not resolve the problem.

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal representation of the project structure leading to the issue, although the root cause might lie outside the code itself (potentially in the project's configuration files or dependencies).

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential solution and explanation of the problem, if found.
